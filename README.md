# SeatAssignment
Code for my Job Interview with Walmart Reston Office

Assumptions: 
Each request is a group that needs to sit together
People prefer to sit towards the middle of the theater
People prefer NOT to sit in the front 4 rows
If a group cannot sit together, they do not want to see the movie

Instructions for build:
1. Compile code using command: g++ theater.cpp
2. run using ./a.out [name of text file]
